# RegData MCP — AI/Privacy Regulatory Compliance Data Infrastructure

## What This Is

A structured, queryable data layer providing machine-readable US AI and privacy law data via MCP (Model Context Protocol) and REST API. Think "Daloopa for regulatory compliance" — not a compliance tool, but the data infrastructure that compliance tools are built on.

## The Opportunity

The US AI regulatory landscape is in genuine chaos: 1,200+ AI-related bills introduced across 50 states in 2025, 38 states adopted 100+ AI-related laws, and major laws are becoming enforceable in 2026 (Colorado AI Act June 2026, EU AI Act August 2026, California ADMT January 2026, Texas TRAIGA January 2026). There is no comprehensive federal AI law, creating a patchwork nightmare.

**Nobody provides structured, machine-queryable, continuously-updated AI regulatory data as developer infrastructure.** Law firms publish free trackers (web pages/PDFs). Enterprise GRC platforms (Regology, Drata) sell to CPOs for $50K-200K/year through sales teams. There is a gap in the middle: developer-facing data infrastructure accessible through MCP and API at price points accessible to startups and engineering teams.

## Status

This project is in the **planning phase**. No code has been written yet. The planning conversation has covered:

- [x] Market analysis and competitive landscape
- [x] Buyer persona identification
- [x] Product strategy (MVP scope, schema design, data sources)
- [x] Distribution strategy (MCP-first)
- [x] Legal/liability framework
- [ ] Technical architecture
- [ ] MCP server implementation
- [ ] Initial data curation (Tier 1 laws)
- [ ] Launch and distribution

## Founder Profile

- Strong in: business strategy, data science, coding
- Weak in: marketing and sales (deliberate constraint shaping the distribution strategy)
- Goal: relatively passive income leveraging agentic AI workflows
- Distribution philosophy: marketplace-native discovery, not outbound sales
