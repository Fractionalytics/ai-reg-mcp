    "summary": "Amends Utah's Artificial Intelligence Policy Act to narrow disclosure requirements to high-risk AI interactions involving sensitive personal information or significant personal decisions in regulated occupations. Establishes safe harbor for AI systems that self-disclose their non-human nature. Extends the AIPA sunset date to July 1, 2027. Prohibits using AI as a defense for consumer protection violations.",
