## Project: RegData MCP

This is a planning-stage project for a structured regulatory data product. **No code exists yet.**

### Before doing anything, read these files in order:
1. `docs/planning-context.md` — Where we left off and what to work on next
2. `docs/product-strategy.md` — MVP scope, schema design, data sources, build sequence
3. `docs/market-analysis.md` — Market dynamics, buyer personas, competitive landscape
4. `docs/legal-liability.md` — Legal framework and risk mitigation
5. `research/competitors.md` — Detailed competitive intelligence

### Key context:
- This project emerged from an extensive strategic planning conversation
- All major strategic decisions have been made (see planning-context.md "Decisions Already Made")
- The founder is a solo operator with business/data science/coding skills but weak on marketing/sales
- Distribution is marketplace-native (MCP directories, API marketplaces) — no outbound sales
- Speed to market matters: key compliance deadlines in mid-2026 create buyer urgency

### What NOT to do:
- Don't re-litigate strategic decisions unless explicitly asked
- Don't build a web dashboard or UI — this is data infrastructure
- Don't build anything that could be construed as legal advice (see legal-liability.md)
- Don't over-engineer — MVP is a curated dataset + simple MCP server, not a real-time pipeline
